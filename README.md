# Cheri Beaman – Training & Pro Tips Portfolio

Welcome! I’m Cheri Beaman, a customer success and training professional with over 15 years of experience representing HP across sales, support, and enablement. Throughout my career, I’ve specialized in making technology approachable—translating complex concepts into clear, engaging content that empowers both customers and internal teams.

Below are three selected pieces from my portfolio that reflect this approach:
- A troubleshooting guide for HP’s Single Cartridge Mode  
- A visual chart comparing printer models  
- A tech explainer on emerging trends like WPA3

Each item was designed to support training, enhance customer understanding, and drive performance across both digital and retail platforms. These samples represent my passion for storytelling, technical clarity, and team enablement.

More samples are available upon request or can be added as needed.
